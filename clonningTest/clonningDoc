In order to implement cloning, we need configure our classes to follow below steps:-
	1-Implement Cloneable interface in our class or its superclass or interface,
	2-Define clone() method which should handle CloneNotSupportedException (either throw or log),
		and in most cases from our clone() method we call the clone() method of the superclass.
	3-And super.clone() will call its super.clone() and chain will continue until 
		call will reach to clone() method of the Object class 
		which will create a field by field mem copy of our object and return it back.

Default equals method checks for references so it should be false. 
If we want to make it true then we need to override equals method.
